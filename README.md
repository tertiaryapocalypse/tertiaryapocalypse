hey! this is where i'll upload any projects i'm particularly satisfied with. i'm still learning a lot of things about coding, so they likely won't be the most polished or professional. as of now i'm learning python and c, and i have a decent amount of experience with javascript/html/css. i use geany text editor which occasionally produces bugs i have to test for outside of my dev environment, so i may not catch everything-- if you find a bug, feel free to reach out to me at tertiaryapocalypse@aol.com
